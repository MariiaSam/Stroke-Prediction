# Classification model: Stroke Prediction

# A model for predicting the risk of stroke in a patient

This project was developed to determine the likelihood of a patient having a stroke. The interactive interface is based on [**Streamlit**](https://stroke.streamlit.app/), which allows you to easily interact with the model and analyze the results.

# üíì**_Summing up_**

**_LogisticRegression_** and **_BalancedRandomForestClassifier_** show the highest sensitivity on the test dataset. However, considering also other metrics such as precision and F1-measure, the balanced random forest may be a more suitable choice for this task.

If the **_primary goal_** is not to miss patients, i.e. minimize false negatives, then the key metric is **_Recall_**, namely the sensitivity for class 1.

Recall determines the proportion of correctly identified patients among all valid patients, which is critical if we are more concerned about a situation where a sick patient is classified as healthy.

The main metric is Recall for a positive class, i.e. minimizing false negatives, and from the presented results, LogisticRegression demonstrates the highest recall for class 1 - 0.74 on the test data, BalancedRandomForestClassifier - 0.72.

This means that 74% and 72% of sick patients, respectively, were correctly identified, which is critical if a diagnostic error can lead to a patient being classified as healthy.

However, it is important to remember that a high level of memorization can be accompanied by low accuracy - a large number of false positives. In my case, the accuracy for class 1 remains low for LogisticRegression - 0.13 and for BalancedRandomForestClassifier - 0.15.

‚úÖ **_Therefore, if the main goal is not to miss sick patients, then LogisticRegression is the most appropriate model._**

# Using

Run the Streamlit application with the command:

streamlit run app.py
```

```
docker run --rm -d -p 8880:8880 rentinbrazil:latest
```

--rm - automatically removes the container after stopping;

-d - runs the container in the background;

-p 8880:8880 - displays port 8880 on the local machine to access the application.

**2. Access to the application:**

After starting the container, the application will be available at the address:

```
http://localhost:8880
```

3. **Stopping the project:**

To stop the project, do:

```
docker ps
```

Then use the command to stop the container:

```
docker stop <container_id>
```

Where <container_id> is your container's identifier, obtained from the docker ps command.
