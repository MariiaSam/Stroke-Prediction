# Classification model: Stroke Prediction

# A model for predicting the risk of stroke in a patient

This project was developed to determine the likelihood of a patient having a stroke. The interactive interface is based on [**Streamlit**](https://stroke.streamlit.app/), which allows you to easily interact with the model and analyze the results.

# **_Model Comparison_**

# üíì**_Summing up_**

The **_LogisticRegression_** model provides stable but generally insufficient performance for the positive class.

If the **_primary goal_** is not to miss patients, i.e. to minimize false negatives, then the key metric is **_Recall_**, namely, the sensitivity for class 1.

Recall determines the proportion of correctly identified patients among all valid patients, which is critical if we are more concerned about the situation when a sick patient is classified as healthy.

The main metric is Recall for the positive class, i.e., minimizing false negatives, and from the results provided, LogisticRegression demonstrates the highest recall for class 1 - 0.74 on the test data.

This means that 74% of sick patients were correctly identified, which is critical if a diagnostic error can lead to a patient being classified as healthy.

However, it's important to remember that high recall can be accompanied by low precision - a lot of false positives. In my case, the precision for class 1 remains low - 0.13, but if the main goal is to minimize missed patients, then logistic regression is the most appropriate.

‚úÖ **_Therefore, if the main goal is not to miss sick patients, then LogisticRegression is the most appropriate model._**

## Rental housing costs depending on the city

![Rental housing costs depending on the city](images/2.png)

‚úÖ **_In S√£o Paulo, the average cost of rent is higher than in other cities._**
**_And this is not surprising, as it is the center of a large agglomeration with a population of 23 million, also one of the largest in the world._**

## Correlation analysis conclusions for rent amount:

![Correlation analysis conclusions for rent amount](images/3.png)

**_Correlation analysis conclusions for rent amount:_**

**_Strong positive relationship_**: variables that are highly positively correlated with rent amount have a direct relationship. That is, when the value of these variables increases, the rent also increases;

- **fire insurance (0.987)**: very strong correlation with rent amount. This is expected as the amount of insurance can be proportional to the rent;

- **bathrooms (0.666)**: having more bathrooms is associated with higher rents. This indicates that living spaces with more amenities are more expensive;

- **parking spaces (0.574)**: housing with parking spaces has higher rents, as it is often a sign of luxury or convenience;

- **rooms (0.537)**: a larger number of rooms is also associated with higher rents, which is consistent with the logic of larger areas;

- **City S√£o Paulo (0.25)**: location strongly influences higher rents.

**_Weak positive relationship_**:

- **area (0.178)**: area has a moderate positive correlation, but is not a key factor. This may indicate that a larger area does not always mean significantly higher rents;

- **property tax (0.107)**: property tax has a weak impact. It is probably taken into account by property owners, but is not a direct indicator of rents.

**_Almost neutral impact:_**

- **floor (0.071)**: floor has a very weak impact on rents, which may depend on the city and the architecture of the buildings;

- **animal accept (0.06)**: minor impacts on rent levels;

- **hoa (0.052)**: small relationship with homeowners' association fees. This may only affect certain types of housing (e.g., apartments in condominiums);

**_Negative correlation_**: variables with a negative correlation have an inverse relationship, i.e., when the value of the variable increases, the rent decreases.

- **animal_not_accept (-0.06)**: in premises where animals are not allowed, rents are slightly lower;

- **furniture_not furnished (-0.17)**: show an inverse relationship, possibly due to tenant preferences.

Cities, for example, city_Belo Horizonte, city_Campinas: In cities with a negative correlation with rent amount, rents may be lower compared to the base cities (e.g. city_S√£o Paulo).

## Models:

# **_Comparisons and conclusions_**

Model evaluation is based on several metrics: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and R¬≤ (coefficient of determination). The best model can be chosen depending on the purpose of the analysis, but in general, lower errors (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and higher R¬≤ indicate a better model.

‚ùé **_Best model:_**

**Best model: Elastic Net (a regularized linear regression)**. Why:

High R¬≤ on training (0.9808) and test (0.9808) data.
The lowest RMSE on the test data (472.42), indicating the best fit to real-world values.

Elastic Net balances the regularization, avoiding overfitting.

**Alternative model: Lasso Regression (a regularized linear regression)**. Why:
The second best R¬≤ on the test data (0.9686).
Low RMSE (627.63), which also indicates good consistency.
Less sensitive to collinearity than simple linear regression.

‚≠ï **_Worst Model:_**

Random Forest overfits the training data, with the highest test errors and reduced generalizability. It may require hyperparameter tuning to improve its performance.
