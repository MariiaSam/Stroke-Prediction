# Classification model: Stroke Prediction

# A model for predicting the risk of stroke in a patient

This project was developed to determine the likelihood of a patient having a stroke. The interactive interface is based on [**Streamlit**](https://stroke-prediction-ms.streamlit.app/), which allows you to easily interact with the model and analyze the results.

## Description

**1. Project objective:** To create an analytical tool to study the risk of stroke in a patient, taking into account various factors

**2. Project objectives:**

**Data analysis**: to identify the factors that influence to the risk of stroke in a patient.

- data analysis: to identify key factors that influence the risk of stroke;
- model Building: use machine learning and statistical analysis to create a model that can predict stroke risk;

# üíì**Summing up**

**_LogisticRegression_** and **_BalancedRandomForestClassifier_** show the highest sensitivity on the test dataset. However, considering also other metrics such as precision and F1-measure, the BalancedRandomForestClassifier may be a more suitable choice for this task.

If the **_primary goal_** is not to miss patients, i.e. minimize false negatives, then the key metric is **_Recall_**, namely the sensitivity for class 1.

Recall determines the proportion of correctly identified patients among all valid patients, which is critical if we are more concerned about a situation where a sick patient is classified as healthy.

The main metric is Recall for a positive class, i.e. minimizing false negatives, and from the presented results, LogisticRegression demonstrates the highest recall for class 1 - 0.74 on the test data, BalancedRandomForestClassifier - 0.72.

This means that 74% and 72% of sick patients, respectively, were correctly identified, which is critical if a diagnostic error can lead to a patient being classified as healthy.

However, it is important to remember that a high level of memorization can be accompanied by low accuracy - a large number of false positives. In my case, the accuracy for class 1 remains low for LogisticRegression - 0.13 and for BalancedRandomForestClassifier - 0.15.

‚úÖ **_Therefore, if the main goal is not to miss sick patients, then LogisticRegression is the most appropriate model._**
